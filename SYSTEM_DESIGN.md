# News Email Sender System Design

## Overview

The News Email Sender project automates the process of fetching the latest news articles on a specified topic and delivering them to recipients via email. Using the News API and Python scripting, this system provides a seamless way to stay informed about current events.

## Architecture

The architecture of the News Email Sender project comprises the following components:

1. **News API Integration:** The project integrates with the News API to fetch the latest news articles based on the specified topic.

2. **Data Fetching (`main.py`):** The `main.py` script retrieves news articles from the News API, extracts relevant details (such as titles, descriptions, and URLs), and prepares the content for email.

3. **Email Sending (`send_email.py`):** The `send_email.py` script handles the email sending process. It configures SMTP server settings, prepares email messages, and sends them to recipients.

4. **Recipient Email Addresses:** The recipient email addresses are specified in the `receiver` field within the `main.py` script.

## Data Flow

1. The `main.py` script initiates the process by making a request to the News API using the specified `topic` and `api_key`.

2. The News API responds with news articles related to the chosen topic.

3. The script extracts article titles, descriptions, and URLs from the API response and compiles them into a formatted email body.

4. The `send_email.py` script is invoked to send the prepared email to the specified recipients.

## File Structure

- `main.py`
- `send_email.py`
- `LICENSE` (License file)
- `README.md` (Project documentation)

## Interaction Flow

1. User customizes the `topic` variable in both `main.py` and `send_email.py`.

2. User adds recipient email addresses to the `receiver` field in `main.py`.

3. User runs the `main.py` script to fetch news articles and send emails.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)

## Note

- Ensure you have a valid News API key and update the `api_key` variable in both scripts.

- This project demonstrates the concept of fetching news and sending emails. In a production environment, consider implementing error handling and security measures.

## Conclusion

The News Email Sender project illustrates how Python scripting can be leveraged to automate news delivery via email. Stay up-to-date with the latest news in a streamlined and efficient manner.
